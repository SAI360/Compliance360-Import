# Compliance 360 Import (Batch Import)
The Compliance 360 Import contains step-by-step instructions and examples for posting data to the Compliance 360 importing purposes. Its focus is for clients (or third-party partners) who are looking to automate the importing of data into a compliance 360 client organization on a regular basis. It first requires that the given Compliance 360 (C360) client organization admin perform relevant integration configurations to permit this activity.
